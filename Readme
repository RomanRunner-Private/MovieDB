1) I've written it using only out-of-the-box approaches as to avoid using Pods/Spm/Carthage or something else third-party frameworks for development. It was done with respect to code reviewers that they won't waste time for project setup.
   I try to not use dependencies whenever it possible.
2) Im aware about well-know bugs I have by this moment that wasn't fixed due to time absence.
3) I would use more efficient approaches so to have more readable codebase If I would have more time.
4) Despite of there are only two screens in the project there are a lot of small chunks of logic that should be considered while develop of project architecture. It wasn't done.
5) Needs refactoring.
6) Protocols not fully used.
7) I didn't use generics so to keep codebase clearer.

18 hours was spent for development (more or less)
